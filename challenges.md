* ~~What if I want to switch data storage to use a DB in production but local while developing?~~
* ~~How do I rewrite the code to be easily ported as a web app, desktop app or an SMS chatbot app?~~
* How can I write high value unit tests that are repeatable, fast, and easy to maintain?
* How do I abstract the code to have as little dependencies on the choice of tech stack as possible?
